DESCRIPTION:

---


It logs all Items (with Name, Stats, Attributes, BaseItem etc)
to nice little XML Files when you leave the game.

With the included D2ParseViewer Program, you can access
the Items in a powerful searchable Database.

Output Directory:
> [2 Installation Directory](Diablo.md)\d2plog\

Output Files:
> [Realm](Realm.md)-[Name](Character.md).xml


---

WHAT IS XML GOOD FOR?

---


XML can be used as a kind of catalog (e.g. Firefox & IExplore),
but also for easily creating applications (with most types of prog. languages)
to build a powerful database (that's what i'd doing right now ^^)


---

REQUIREMENTS:

---


- Actual BlueVex (RedVex Plugin) from www.redvex.net (Tested with Bluevex version 5.3)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP 1 from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx


---

INSTALLATION:

---


Just Put the file D2Parser.dll to:
> [Directory](BlueVex.md)/ManagedPlugins

Additionally install D2ParseViewer.air (Requires ADOBE AIR from http://www.adobe.com/products/air)
to View the Output in a searchable Database Program


---

HOW TO USE:

---


- Start Bluevex and Enable both D2Parser Game and Chat Plugins
- Start Diablo 2 and play

The Plugin is running totally in the background, you have to leave the game before a file is created

- Start D2ParseViewer
- Locate the d2plog directory in your Diablo 2 Install Directory
- Have Fun


---

SECURITY:

---


The Plugin is NOT phishing any Account Names/Passwords
The Plugin is not sending ANY packets to BNET or elsewhere
The Plugin reads your Diablo 2 InstallPath Key from your Registry, nothing else
The Plugin creates and writes to xml files in the "d2plog" directory, it doesn't read or write any other files

I am not responsible for Realm/Key Bans
(but you will hardly get one as the Plugin doesn't send anything to BNET and also doesn't touch the diablo 2 memory)

CREDITS:

---


I want to thank my mom, my dad, my friends, my fans etc... no... just kidding

Credits go to the RedVex and BlueVex dev community for answering my noob questions,
Also to ET for his godly d2smells,
To DeZimTox for letting me get an idea about BlueVex development (w his OS plugins),
And to everyone else i forgot

I'd be very grateful if anybody would PM me @redvex with attached bugged xml output.
